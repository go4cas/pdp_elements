`pdp elements` is ablog series about building the uber eCommerce Product Deatil Page (PDP), using [web components](http://webcomponents.org/). I'll aim to take you through the basic composition of a PDP, and then dive into the detail around each component.

Through the articles we will build a set of web components, hosted in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/go4cas/pdp_elements/tree/master).

The blog series will follow this sequence:

* Overview of the PDP
* Introduction to web components
* The tools and workflow for building our element catalogue
* Our first element
* Series on building the main elements for the PDP
